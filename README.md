Star-Wars MAy the force be with you.

## Setup
Start off by cloning the repository and `cd`ing into the project directory.

Make sure you have the correct node version. You need version 8.9.0 or later. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions or do it yourself.

Next we'll install all dependencies using `npm`. 

```bash
$ npm install
```

Now that all of our dependencies have been installed, we can run the
development server by running

```bash
$ npm start
```

And that's it! You should now be able to open http://localhost:3000 in your
browser to see the application running.

## Test
Can be run by

```bash
$ npm test
```
